# scripts/release.sh does the signing and refuses to do it badly; this wraps
# it so a release is one command run from anywhere, rather than a cd, a push,
# a script and another push - which is four chances to stop halfway and leave
# main pushed with no tag on it, or a tag on a commit origin has never seen.
#
# It does NOT commit your work. Commit first, with whatever message the change
# deserves; this ships what is already committed.

# Usage:  scripts/ship.sh v0.2
#         ~/Documents/Kudde/scripts/ship.sh v0.2      (from anywhere)
