"""What release this server is actually running.

Until update_server.bat existed, nothing on the server could answer that.
The only version anywhere was Kudde.VERSION in frontend/shared/api.js,
painted into the two app headers - which tells you what a *browser* loaded,
not what the server is serving, and those disagree exactly when it matters
(a phone holding a cached copy of the previous release).

The version is not invented here. scripts/release.sh already refuses to sign
a tag whose Kudde.VERSION disagrees with it, so on any checkout that came
from a release those two agree by construction. What was missing was a
runtime, server-side link to the git tag - and a way to see when that
correspondence has been broken by hand.

Four states, in order of preference, all reported honestly rather than
collapsed into one string:

    release   git describe --exact-match found a signed release tag
    ahead     a checkout between releases, e.g. v0.1-4-gb1182b3 (a dev machine)
    reported  no usable git, but update_server.bat left the tag it installed
    unknown   none of the above

frontend_version is parsed from api.js in every state, with the same anchored
expression release.sh uses. That is the floor: it works with no git, no tags
and no data/ directory, so the endpoint always says something true.

Nothing in here raises. A version endpoint that can 500 is worse than no
version endpoint, because it fails on exactly the unhealthy servers you most
want to hear from. Adapted from Boord's backend/version.py.
