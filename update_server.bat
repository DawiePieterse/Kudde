:: Kudde - double-click this file to update to the newest signed release from
:: GitHub, install any new dependencies, and restart the server so the update
:: actually takes effect.
:: See UPDATING.md for what this automates and how to do it by hand.
::
:: This deliberately does NOT "git pull" a branch. A branch pull trusts
:: whoever can push to the repo, and this script runs elevated on a machine
:: whose server runs as SYSTEM - so a stolen GitHub token would mean code
:: execution on every farm running Kudde. Instead it checks out a tag that
:: carries a GPG signature from the release key, and refuses to update at all
:: if that signature is missing, broken, or made by any other key. Pushing
:: code is then not enough to ship it; you also have to hold the signing key.
::
:: Adapted from Boord's update_server.bat, which has been doing this on real
:: farm servers for a while - the comments below that read like scar tissue
:: are exactly that.

:: --check looks for a newer signed release and writes what it found to
:: data\update_available.json, without checking anything out. It is what the
:: "Kudde Update Check" scheduled task runs, and it shares this script rather
:: than living in one of its own on purpose: the fingerprint pinning, the tag
:: selection and the signature check below are the security-critical part, and
:: a second copy of them would be a second thing to keep right.

:: Jumped over rather than wrapped in a block: with delayed expansion on,
